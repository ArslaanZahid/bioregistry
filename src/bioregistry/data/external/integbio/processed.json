Equally-spliced variants between these mammals were identified and compared sets are available. Splice sites and motifs that affect SNPs in humans, RASVs that affect protein function in humans and AS junctions tedetced by RNA-Sez tags are provided.",

Whereas, conventionally, derivatives are prepared through a lengthy process of 'hit-or-miss' procedures, searching this collection of data produces a result of suggested heavy-atom reagents for the target protein, determined by its crystallization conditions and amino-acid sequence. Using this database when studying the structure-determining process of target proteins, revealed that 93 particular sequences (motifs) were more often noticed to be present at the actual heavy-atom binding sites. These sequences are therefore perceived to be preferred for successful heavy-atom binding. The site provides a link to the RIKEN Harima Heavy-atom Database.",
